== Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for https://datasonnet.com[DataSonnet].

DataSonnet is a new open source data transformation tool. At its core is JSonnet, a highly portable programming language for manipulating data, originally designed for creating configurations.

DataSonnet repurposes JSonnet for data transformation by providing

- additional libraries,
- conventions for executing JSonnet for transformations,
- tooling,
- and documentation focused on data transformation.
