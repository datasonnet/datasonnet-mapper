== Obtaining the CLI Jar

The CLI jar is a version that contains all dependencies.

You can download the current CLI jar at https://datasonnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jars/datasonnet-mapper-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

We recommend renaming the jar to datasonnet.jar for simplicity.


////
Alternatively, if you have maven installed, you can download it as datasonnet.jar with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn dependency:get -Ddest=datasonnet.jar -Dartifact=com.datasonnet:datasonnet-mapper:1.0.1-SNAPSHOT:jar:jar-with-dependencies
----

After you run that, you’ll have a file named datasonnet.jar in the directory you’re currently in.

== Using the CLI via the Jar

In the same directory as datasonnet.jar, you can use the cli with the following base command:

----

java -jar datasonnet.jar

----

For example, performing a transformation would be

----
java -jar datasonnet.jar run mapping.ds input.json
----
